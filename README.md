For the classification task, the K-NN Classifier is employed to handle the class imbalance in the MAGIC gamma telescope dataset. Different values of K are experimented with to optimize model performance, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are reported.

For the regression task, the project utilizes the California Houses prices dataset to predict median house values. Linear regression, lasso regression, and ridge regression are applied to the data, and model performance is evaluated using Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error metrics.
